This file contains the design decision for the project

->	Use beaglebone black for processing
->	LCD(QT?) for display
->	Infinite presets(3 for now)
->	XML file for storing presets and channel states and names

Future expansions:
-> 	Bluetooth connection with android device
->	Creating presets and loops via android app
->  Pulling presets and loops into android app
-> 	Custom names for channels and presets
->	Loop recall via app and lcd gui(space permitting)
